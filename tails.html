    <p>
      Scottish fold cats can develop arthritis in their tails at a young age. This condition is very painful. You may notice your Scottish fold cat holding his tail stiffly or pulling away when you try to pet it.
      <br> Ask your veterinarian to examine your Scottish fold catâ€™s tail during routine exams.
